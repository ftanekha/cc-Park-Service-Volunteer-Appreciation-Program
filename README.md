### Park Service Volunteer Appreciation Program

The Park Service has just inherited two parks: Wolf Point Park and Raccoon Meadows. 
Each park has a volunteer program where volunteers help maintain the parks by cleaning campsites, 
planning educational events, and maintaining hiking trails.

The Park Service would like to combine their volunteers and introduce a volunteer appreciation program,
where the top volunteers get a special edition park badge for their service. 
It’s your job to help complete a program that was partially written by a colleague to help the Park Service determine this season’s top volunteers.

You’ll need to 
- take your colleague’s code, 
- combine data from both park’s volunteer logs, then 
- calculate which volunteers have the most hours.

**Get your bug spray and hiking boots and let’s type out this program!**


## Welcome to the Park Service. Let’s inspect some of the code that already exists so that we can get familiar with the data we’ll be working with:

- index.ts: Contains incomplete code that a colleague put together. 
At the top of their code, they’re importing data and types from a couple of files. 
Later on in their code, they made some incomplete functions, defined some types, and began on some of the logic we can use to calculate volunteer hours.
- tsconfig.json: Defines the rules for TypeScript to compile code into JavaScript.
It’s worthwhile to look through these files so that you’ll understand the structure of this project.
